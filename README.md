🔺 Triangle Area Calculator (Java)
📌 Project Overview

The Triangle Area Calculator is a Java console application designed to help learners progress from basic to expert-level Java concepts. The program calculates the area of a triangle using user-provided width (base) and height, while gradually introducing better logic, validation, and control structures.

This repository contains three versions of the calculator:

Basic Version – formula calculation only

Intermediate Version – input validation using if-else and logical OR (||)

Expert Version – uses switch-case for menu-based control flow

🧮 Formula Used

All versions use the standard triangle area formula:

Area = (width × height) × 0.5

🚀 Features
✅ Basic Version

Accepts user input for width and height

Calculates the triangle area

Displays the result in the console

Focuses on basic Java syntax

✅ Intermediate Version

Uses if-else statements

Validates user input

Prevents calculation if width OR height equals 0

Displays error messages for invalid input

✅ Expert Version

Uses a menu-driven system

Implements switch-case statements

Allows users to choose actions (e.g., calculate area, exit)

Demonstrates structured program flow

More scalable and maintainable logic

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)

Command Line Interface (CLI)

▶️ How to Run the Program

Clone the repository:

gh repo clone EljenMae/TriangleAreaCalculator


Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

Navigate to the src folder.

Run one of the following files:

TriangleAreaCalculator.java → Basic

IntermediateTriangleAreaCalculator.java → Intermediate

ExpertTriangleAreaCalculator.java → Expert

Follow the on-screen instructions.

🧑‍💻 Sample Input (Basic Version)
-- Welcome to Basic Triangle Area Calculator --
Enter width: 10
Enter height: 5

📤 Sample Output (Basic Version)
The area of the triangle is: 25.0

⚠️ Input Validation (Intermediate Version)

The IntermediateTriangleAreaCalculator validates input using an if-else statement with the logical OR (||) operator.

Validation Rule

If width == 0 OR height == 0, the calculation is stopped.

Example Logic
if (width == 0 || height == 0) {
    System.out.println("Width or height cannot be zero.");
} else {
    double area = (width * height) * 0.5;
    System.out.println("The area of the triangle is: " + area);
}

🧠 Expert Version (Using switch-case)

The ExpertTriangleAreaCalculator uses a menu-based approach controlled by a switch-case statement.

Example Menu
1. Calculate Triangle Area
2. Exit

Example Logic
switch (choice) {
    case 1:
        // ask for width and height
        // calculate and display area
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Exiting program...");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid choice.");
}

What This Teaches

How switch-case works

Better program structure

How to build scalable console applications

Cleaner control flow compared to multiple if-else blocks

📚 Learning Objectives

Use Scanner for user input

Apply arithmetic operations

Use if-else statements

Apply logical OR (||) for validation

Implement switch-case for menu systems

Write clean and readable Java code

Understand program flow from beginner to expert level

✅ Future Improvements

Validate negative numbers

Support decimal input using double

Loop menus using while

Add exception handling (try-catch)

Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
