# Triangle Area Calculator (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Triangle Area Calculator** is a simple Java application that calculates the area of a triangle using user-provided base and height values. This project is designed for beginners to understand basic Java concepts such as input handling, variables, arithmetic operations, and console output.

## 🧮 Formula Used

The program uses the standard mathematical formula:

```
Area = (base × height) / 2
```

## 🚀 Features

* Accepts user input for base and height
* Calculates the area of a triangle accurately
* Displays the result in the console
* Simple and beginner-friendly Java code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA / Any Java IDE
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
